# Quick Reference: Xcode Build Settings for Permissions

## Interactive AI Project - Required Build Settings

### Debug Configuration

```text
GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = YES
INFOPLIST_KEY_NSMicrophoneUsageDescription = "This app needs microphone access for speech recognition and interactive AI conversations."
INFOPLIST_KEY_NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription = "This app uses speech recognition to convert your voice into text for AI conversations."
```

### Release Configuration

```text
GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = YES
INFOPLIST_KEY_NSMicrophoneUsageDescription = "This app needs microphone access for speech recognition and interactive AI conversations."
INFOPLIST_KEY_NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription = "This app uses speech recognition to convert your voice into text for AI conversations."
```

## How to Apply These Settings

### Method 1: Xcode Interface

1. Select project in navigator
2. Choose target "Interactive AI"
3. Go to "Build Settings" tab
4. Search for "INFOPLIST_KEY"
5. Add the required keys and values

### Method 2: Direct project.pbxproj Edit

Add these lines to both Debug and Release build configurations:

```text
INFOPLIST_KEY_NSMicrophoneUsageDescription = "This app needs microphone access for speech recognition and interactive AI conversations.";
INFOPLIST_KEY_NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription = "This app uses speech recognition to convert your voice into text for AI conversations.";
```

## Verification Steps

1. Build the project
2. Check that no "Multiple commands produce Info.plist" errors occur
3. Run app on device/simulator
4. Verify permission dialogs appear when accessing microphone/speech recognition
5. Confirm permission descriptions match the configured text

## Troubleshooting

- **Error**: Multiple Info.plist commands → Remove manual Info.plist files
- **Error**: Permission denied → Check INFOPLIST_KEY values are set
- **Error**: No permission dialog → Verify keys are in both Debug/Release configs
